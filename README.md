# SecretSanta: This app allows you to make Secret Santa picks completely anonymously and send emails to participants.
To use, add a txt file named "emails" with each line in this format: {email}<TAB>{name}.
SMTP username and password are stored in .env and can be easily changed.
The app attaches a PNG file named "obrazek.png" to each email, which you can replace.
